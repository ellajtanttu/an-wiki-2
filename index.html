                <li>
                  Male humpback whales found in U.S. waters sing complex songs
                  in winter breeding areas in waters near Hawaii, in the
                  Caribbean, and elsewhere that can last up to 20 minutes and be
                  heard miles away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The blue whale is the largest animal that ever lived and can
                  grow to 90 or more feet and weigh as much as 24 elephants!
                  That’s more than 330,000 pounds (150,000 kg).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some species of whales are among the longest lived mammals.
                  Scientists estimate bowhead whales (a baleen whale found in
                  the Arctic) can live for more than 200 years, and killer
                  whales (a toothed whale found in various habitats worldwide)
                  can live for more than 100 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Killer whales are highly social and often travel in groups
                  that are matrifocal—a family unit focused or centered on the
                  mother. Learn more about the Southern Resident killer whale, a
                  NOAA Fisheries Species in the Spotlight.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gray whales make one of the longest annual migrations of any
                  mammal: they travel about 10,000 miles (16,000 km) round trip!

              <h4>Octopus</h4>
              <h6>Fun Facts:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Octopuses are widely considered to be the most intelligent of
                  all invertebrates. Scientists say octopuses are capable of
                  learning from experience and maintaining short- and long-term
                  memory. They've also been observed using tools in an
                  intelligent manner -- such as coconuts for personal
                  fortresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Octopuses have three hearts. And blue blood. Two hearts serve
                  to move blood past the gills, while the third pumps blood
                  through the rest of the body.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Saying "octopi" is incorrect (unfortunately). Though "octopi"
                  is colloquially sound and very fun to say, the correct plural
                  of octopus is octopuses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They aren't called "tentacles," they're called ''arms." Which,
                  again, is way less fun. Tentacles are reserved for squid,
                  cuttlefish and nautiluses. Octopuses have eight arms, zero
                  tentacles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  And each arm has a mind of its own. Some two-thirds of an
                  octopus's neurons reside in its arms, meaning they can react
                  to stimuli and function at a fairly high level on their own,
                  even when severed from the body.

                  The first animal to ask an existential question was from a
                  parrot named Alex. He asked what color he was, and learned
                  that it was grey.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are an estimated 550 wild parrots living in NYC that
                  were accidentally released from a shipment at JFK airport in
                  the late 60s.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the African Grey parrot N’kisi first met Jane Goodall, he
                  recognized her from a photograph and asked “Got a chimp?” It
                  is claimed that this was a possible display of a sense of
                  humor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Australian Night Parrot is the most elusive and mysterious
                  bird in the world only three people have had a confirmed
                  sighting in over a century.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is a metal band called Hatebeak whose lead singer is an
                  African grey parrot.
